# Semantic-segmentation-of-aircrafts-Deep-Learning
This project aims to accurately identify and perform semantic segmentation of aircraft in images. Using a dataset of labeled aircraft images and segmentation masks, we develop and train machine learning models to detect aircraft and differentiate them from other objects in a given scene.
